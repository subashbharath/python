    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called a derived class or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (called a base class or superclass). This enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "- It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Inheritance\n",
    "- Single Inheritance: Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class.\n",
    "- Multilevel Inheritance: Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class. \n",
    "- Hierarchical Inheritance: Hierarchical-level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.\n",
    "- Multiple Inheritance: Multiple-level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class."

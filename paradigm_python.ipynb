    "### Object Oriented programming paradigms\n",
    "In the object-oriented programming paradigm, objects are the key element of paradigms. Objects can simply be defined as the instance of a class that contains both data members and the method functions.\n",

    "the code can be easily reusable,  Python supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are key concepts in OOP.\n",

    "- Code reusability\n",
    "- Abstraction or data hiding\n",

    "Functional programming paradigms is a paradigm in which everything is bind in pure mathematical functions style. It is known as declarative paradigms because it uses declarations overstatements. It uses the mathematical function and treats every statement as functional expression as an expression is executed to produce a value. Lambda functions or Recursion are basic approaches used for its implementation.\n",
